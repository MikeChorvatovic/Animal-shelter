purpose of our tool is:

Adoption Matching System: An AI system that analyzes the personality traits, behavior patterns, and preferences of animals in the shelter, along with potential adopters' profiles, to suggest ideal matches. This could increase the chances of uccessful adoptions.
Lost and Found Pet Recognition: Implementing image recognition AI to match lost pets with those in the shelter could reunite more animals with their owners.
